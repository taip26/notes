Use quantum computing in machine learning
GD with superposition (shroding GD)
 - simulate path 1 and 2, so 50% chance of success rate instead of 0 with bad initialization

Path integration of all GD paths

2 directions to take this
 - Quantum for multi-objective optimization
 - Hardware-efficient Deployment
