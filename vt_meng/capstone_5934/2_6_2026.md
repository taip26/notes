# Notes

Want center plot to become main display
 - each trace should be able to be shown side-by-side

Peaks graph
 - top one is rowcol
 - bot is each individual pixel
 - heat map can be used for this; keep both plots

to left of peaks graph pcb and ic outputs
 - need to display each table outputs to the right, select menu?

Data saving
 - should be lossless compared to display

PCB IC datastreams are combined
 - one is 12 bits and the other is 4 bits, each is in 2 bytes
