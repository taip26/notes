# Image Transformations

Parametric
 - change coordinates of pixels
 - can solve for parameters 

Non-uniform scaling
 - to avoid holes in image when scaling up solve for inverse
 - not all warps are invertible

Rotation
1. represent in polar form (x = rcos(theta), y = rsin(theta))
2. apply trig identities
3. substitute polar form into trig identities
 - linear transformation since they are linear in terms of x and y
 - for rotation matrices, R^-1 = R^T
Affine transformations
- parallel lines remain parallel

cross-correlation outputs the flipped version from convolution
