# Fourier

transform pairs
 - as the signal is spread out more, it gets more peaky in the fourier space

2d fourier tranforms is just 1d with an extra variable
 - separability - can compute rows then cols
 - finer details further away from origin - means higher frequency
 - center is 0 freq so it is brightest (average intensity of img)
 - as sinc gets bigger filter gets smaller
