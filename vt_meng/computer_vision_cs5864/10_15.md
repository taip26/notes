## NeRFs

train neural network to model plentoptic function

maps 5-d input (x,y,z,theta,phi) -> (r,g,b,sigma)
 - sigma density is used to represent occlusion


# Deep Learning

hinge loss
 - add a margin to loss function (must exceed 1 to avoid loss)

L1 reg tries to make some weights 0 (sparsity)
L2 reg spreads the magnitude of larger weights out to reduce larger weights
dropout is another regularization
