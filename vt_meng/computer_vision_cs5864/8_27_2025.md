# Computer Vision History

Shakey the Robot (1972)

Spring model 70s
 - structural representation of different models

Modern approach is fine-tuning a pre-trained model on ImageNet dataset

Trying to de-bias ImageNet
 - balance for gender, skin color, age, etc.

# Foundations, Filters, Features, Flow

Computer vision is not solved yet
 - Reasoning/common sense are difficult topics

Python OpenCV package reads images as BGR, may need to reorder into RGB

interpolate missing cells from neighbors in bayer grid

High frequency for images is fine-grain-ness of details

Alias - subsampled frequency is mistaken for a lower-frequency signal
