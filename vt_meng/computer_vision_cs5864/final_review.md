# FINAL REVIEW RAHHHH

## Midterm question review
Vaer filters
 - Green light is the most sensitive to human perception so there is double the amount in a vaer filter
Low pass filters
 - the middle of Freq Domain has stuff, allowing the low freq to pass through
High Pass filters
 - the middle is black and the stuff is outside, allowing high freq to pass
Transformation matrix
 - 2x2 cant do translation
Gaussian better than box
 - no ringing
 - fourier pair is gaussian instead of sinc
sharpen
 - blur img
 - subtract blur from og to get details
 - add details to img
rotation can be undone with -theta
inverse warping is better since it doesn't have holes
separability of filters
 - if sep, n^2m, n^2m^2 if not sep
salt pepper filtering - median
REVIEW FOURIER TRANSFORM DIRECTIONALITY
infinite vp's
fourier of gaussian is inversely wrt variance
REVIEW BASELINE ERROR
essential matrix and fundmatrix are not invertible
nyquist-shannon theorem for aliasing
canny edge detector
 - sobel can be separated into blur and derivative
impulse <-> constant
sinc <-> box
REVIEW how to use 2nd moment matrix and harris corner detector
