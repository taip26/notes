# Scientific Labs of the Future: An Ecosystem for Mult-Domain Autonomous Science

## Speaker: Rob Moore
 - Director Interconnected Science Ecosystem and Labs of the Future Inititives

Summary:
How can we leverage AI in science in our ecosystem and resources?
  - Stone, metal, semiconductor, information age
  - Entering AI age
  - Fast adoption of AI tech compared to other big tech (google, facebook, etc.)
Ecosystem for science
  - interoperability
  - flexibility
  - scalability
Scientific method has changed - no longer 

AI-Orchestrated Autonomous and Connected Research Ecosystem
  - AI Agent drive autonomous experiments with Humans in/on/out of the workflow loop

Use assistants to aid in science

Systems of Systems architecture
  - break down experimental tasks into smallest components, each component is a system
  - microservice architecture, simple message passing
  - message abstractions allow for distributed labs to work with each other
  - E2E connections - connect instruments to hi-perform computing

Solutions
  - proposed soln can be using CV and NN to automatically find features of interest
  - 3d prints can be senstive to parameters or have strange structures/weaknesses due to printing process
    - model the 3d print, can view in a 3d fashion
      - reuse the features of interest 3d model thing from above!
  - Electric grid - takes several weeks to simulate 0.2s
    - use AI to optimize grid
  - Autonomous Chemistry Lab
    - can use AI to analyze

Co-Design
  - one group works on ecosystem; other works with domain experts to adapt to ecosystem

LLMs
  - trained on scientific journals
    - biased towards positive results

AI Agents
  - need to prepare science domain for AI
  - a lot of scientific data is physical, how to convert to digital?
  
AI sucks at extrapolation
  - need to fuse datasets so the AI can think holistically

use nested workflow to accomplish e2e science

role of humans change

Recommendation:
Would you take their class?

Would you choose them as your research advisor?

Would you invite them to serve on your advisory committee?
