Research is aligning computing education with modern swe 
typical workflow is programming assignment -> deadline -> submit to autograder -> give feedback based on autograder
 - good in that it scales, bad in that professors only know the end product
 - final code artifact is heavily studied since there's a lot of it
 - process is less known
  - debugging, code comprehension, testing, incremental development, etc

Academia industry gap
 - coding from scratch vs coding in existing codebases
 - submit final code artifact vs iterative incremental process
 - correctness vs correctness, quality, security
 - GenAI adoption

imperative to address pedagogically
 - for students, improve career readiness and value of degree
 - less onboarding cost and more productive for developers
 - only 57% complete an internship
 - entry software is shrinking

incremental development
 - live coding has perceived good programming process, student learning, engagement, but no concrete data to support
 - live coding had no improvement on progrmming processes, student learning, and negative engagement compared to static coding analysis
 - active live coding no improvement on prog proc, stu learn, but had higher engagement

 understanding large codebases
 - in students, usually writing something from scratch
 - in industry, usually making a relatively small change to a large codebase
 - in a large code base, 58% of time is spent understanding, 24% is navigation, 5% is editing

student struggles
 - over-reliance on opportunistic searches
 - poor documentation use
 - stuck at first relevant code location
 - stuck on irrelevant lines of searching

GenAI integration
 - trust in GenAI assistants
 - if trust low, low adoption of benefits
 - if trust is high, risk of security
 - short term trust is high, long term is low
 - NLP helps calibrate trust, perceptions of correctness changes trust, and awareness of features helps calibrate trust
 - many students go for 1 shot prompts, leading to debugging and testing (traditional cs principles)
 - vibe coding can introduce swe concepts in early cs education such as version control and understanding the large code base generated by the ai

learning portion
 - paper handout and large github codebase
 - idle repo for python
 - try to change line number feature (in sidebar.py)
 - most students use diagnostic print statements instead of debugger
 - showed the strengths and weakness of debugger and print
 - quick demo of debugger in action
 - good explanation of basic debugging concepts for early computer science students
 - breaks down concepts well, good pacing for a condensed lecture

teaching and mentoring policy
 - impart effective processes
 - in teaching, good programming process
 - in research, research process
 - preparing students for long-term success
 - computing for social good

future work
 - computing eduction in genai
 - smaller emphasis on wode writing, bigger emphasis on other skills
 - ide-based programming coach
