Traditional methods of design and control methods for robot development is tedious and costly

The proposed solution is a co-design approach to design and control that allows iterative

End-to-end system has better learning curve than a model-based system

Modular multi-robot systems for terrarin traversal - need to work together to traverse negative space
- coupling mechanism where robots can slide into each other on flat terrain but lock in once negative terrain is encountered
- rigid design isn't the best for different types of terrain

Distributed MCP scales better with more robots
- loss treats each robot as independent and other robots as static obstacles

Coupling design and control simplifies optimizing both variables

Building an end-to-end system
- soft gripper system
- design space is tendon routing and stiffness
- optimize object force, pose, -ground collision
- randomly sample different configurations of variables adove
- use neural physics model to get a loss for gradient descent
- results in asymmetric design where one gripper is more rigid and other conforms to shape 
- jointly optimized simulation performed the best compared to soft, semi-rigid, and individually optimized
- nonintuitive designs (asymmetric stiffness)
- neural physics model has a more stable optimization landscape than traditional contact-gradient methods
- scaling up helps a lot

Geometry design space
- geometry is very complex as it scales up
- use human as the control policy
- allows the design to fit the style of the teleoperator 

generate robot hand to fit human design
- having robot hands are desirable since they have a large corpus of data from human hands
- design params, joint angles are control policy
- fingertip positions are data
- mimic joint - upper part of joint mimics bottom motion
- trajectories -> latent -> actor -> use evaluations to improve actor 
- can generate a mesh to create the joint design
- can get joints to operate in a way that humans can't

future directions
- latent space for design
- learn 3d printing paths
- hardware-in-the-loop for design
